Topic - Survey on popular web development frameworks

Abstract

Web development frameworks have become an essential tool for developers to build efficient web applications. They simplify and streamline the development of web applications, ultimately enabling developers to save time and reduce expenses. A web framework provides access to ready-made components, snippets of code, or templates that aid in web development. There are numerous web development frameworks available. Before choosing a framework, we need to have an idea about their benefits, performance and scalability. This paper provides a survey on some of the popular web frameworks, their distinctive features and the advantages they offer. This analysis would help in taking an informed decision on which framework to choose that best meets a userâ€™s requirements.
