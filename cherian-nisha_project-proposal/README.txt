Shopitz - A Shopping Planner website

About the website:

With the advent of online shopping, customers have a variety of options for a product that they need. When there are multiple options available, it is difficult to choose which one would be the right one. So, a tool to help them research and compare different options both online and offline becomes a necessity. This website would help users to track their shopping needs. Once a user logs in to the system, they will be able to see an existing list they have made or else will be able to make a new list. Also, users can compare prices of an item across various online shopping websites. For this, a user can enter the links from different shopping websites and its price. This helps them to research and finally decide on what to buy.
